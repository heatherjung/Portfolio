      <h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>
      <p>The VARK app is a project I designed while completing a UX Fundamentals Course through CareerFoundry. I worked on user research, prototyping, and usability testing.</p>

          <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
          <p>College is an exciting time because there are so many things to do, see, and experience. Many students have difficulty balancing academics, social life, and sleep. According to a survey conducted at Desales University, procrastination is a huge problem for many students because they get easily distracted. Unfortunately, not many students know how to study efficiently or effectively.</p>

          <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
          <p>In my research, I found that most v

          <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
          <p>Design a vocabulary app that allows college students to learn, memorize, and retain new words. Make learning fun and interactive so that students could be motivated to study.
          </p>

          <h2>TOP THREE FEATURES</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You can choose your learning preference!</li>
            <li>You can win a free gift after gaining a number of points!</li>
            <li>You can structure which days to study and how much time to put in per day.</li>
          <br><hr>

          <h1>APPROACH</h1>
          <p>This being my first project, I had a lot to learn. The easy part was conducting user research and synthesizing the collected data, but </p>

          <h1>CHALLENGE</h1>
          The VARK app provides various learning preferences, provides an incentive for rewards, and establishes structure to enforce good study habits. 

          <p>The three main themes that emerged from my observations were:</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Poor Categorization</strong>
            <br>
            I found that the "JustAnswer" app was difficult to navigate because of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unalphabetized categories (ex: experts' name or expertise)</li>
            <li>No search engine</li>
            <li>Cluttered information</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Unnecessary Video Calls</strong>
            <br>
            A question that arose was whether or not video calls were necessary.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Simple questions don't require video calls.</li>
            <li>Is it worth paying to use video call?</li>
            <li>Video calls may be uncomfortable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Hesitant using a Q&A app</strong>
            <br>
            There were some reasons people were hesitant to use a Q&A app, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using other methods of obtaining information</li>
            <li>Trustworthiness of experts</li>
            <li>Miscommunication</li>
            <li>Not getting your question answered</li>
            <li>Feeling of not getting your money's worth</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          
          <h2>USER INTERVIEWS & SURVEYS</h2>
          <p>I used a combination of user interviews and user surveys since these research methods were the most viable options, being low cost and having easy access to a pool of participants. Using the information gathered from the competitor analysis, I then narrowed down on three research goals to help me conduct <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XDCNYW7">user surveys</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aKQdMXWdoeNNtcQKOi7lmN8beUXe1Qcm46mkjC6lgyY/edit">user interviews</a>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Consider the factors that create a frustrating experience.
            </li>
            <li>Identify the process of how people ask questions and what resources are used.
            </li>
            <li>Determine preferred methods of communication when connecting to experts.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>My target audience were tech-savy young adults who fell in the age range of 18-30 years. Through the user interviews and surveys, I have found that most people use Google to search for their answers on a regular basis because it's quick and convenient. When using Google search, most people do not have a question fully formulated and instead use keywords to ask their questions.</p>
          <br>

          <h2>AFFINITY MAPPING</h2>
          <p>After data collection on 26 individuals (6 user interviews & 20 user surveys), affinity mapping was conducted to further explore the users' behaviors, attitudes, frustrations, and needs.</p>

            <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(3)"></span> 
          </div>


          <h2>GENERATING INSIGHTS</h2>
          <p>Here are the insights that I have gained through affinity mapping:</p>
          <div><img src="img/creatingpersona.jpeg" alt="persona" class="chart"></div>
          <br>
          <hr>

          <h1 class="center">DEFINING THE PROBLEM</h1>
          <p>Now that I have a basic understanding of q&a apps as well as my target audience, the next step is to define the problem statement using the user persona, user journey, and user stories. 
          <h3>Process:</h3><p>User Persona, User Journey, & User Stories</p>

          <h2>USER PERSONA</h2>
          <p>Based on the user research, I created three personas to refer to throughout my design process. A persona is a representation of the users’ daily needs, motivations, challenges, and frustrations. For this case study, I have decided to show one persona. It's time to meet Ryan.</p><br>
          <p>Ryan is a professor at a university who has passion for learning and exploring his hobbies. He currently started a woodworking project that he needs help on. He knows this type of project isn't something that could be easily learned by reading websites and books but that the best way to learn is by getting hands-on experience and doing it. With his busy schedule and the complexity of the project, Ryan is looking for an expert who could help him out long-term.</p>
          <div><img src="img/ryan_persona.png" alt="Ryan_Persona" class="ryan">
          </div>

          <h2>USER JOURNEY</h2>
          <p>A user journey demonstrates the visual process of what Ryan would think, do, and experience as he accomplishes a specific goal. When we take a closer look at Ryan, we can begin to think about what the product would need in order to bring value to his life.</p>
          <div><img src="img/ryan_userjourney.png" alt="Ryan_Journey" class="ryan">
          </div>

          <h2>USER STORIES</h2>
          <p>User stories are crucial to translate human needs into functional requests. The goal of user stories is to develop a clear understanding of what Ryan wants to achieve. After creating user stories, I gathered some final insights and formed a problem statement.</p>
          <div><img src="img/userstories.png" alt="userstories" class="chart"></div>

          <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
          <p>Ryan needs a reliable way to get his questions answered by experts because this would save him time from going to other resources. We want the app to have easy access to experts, various methods of communication, and the ability to keep track of his questions and experts.</p>

          <h1 class="center">THE FRAMEWORK</h1>
           <h3>Ideating Solutions:</h3><p>User Flow, Card Sorting, Sitemap, & Wireframing</p>
           <br>

           <h2>USER FLOW</h2>
            <p>Here is a user flow of how a specific expert would be added. 
          </p>
          <div><img src="img/userflow.png" alt="userflow" class="userflow"></div>

          <h2>CARD SORTING</h2>
          <p>Closed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bALJgq5lH2xiTOOQZc0GU8KeuqpamYOUIHcwXU-fis/edit">card sorting</a> was conducted on five participants using a physical test. They grouped the product content of 43 cards into the 8 defined categories. The average amount of time spent completing this study was 11.29 minutes.
          </p>
          <h3 class="blue">Key Findings:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Users are able to match content topics to the categories better if there is a word in the content topic that matches the word in the category. For example, all 5 users placed “Save Expert” and “Expert ratings” under the category of “Experts.”</li><br>
            <li>“Book a call” should be accessed through multiple categories, such as “Ask” and “Experts.” This function should not stand independently since it is dependent on having a question in mind.</li><br>
            <li>Although users have different thoughts to what should be on the "Dashboard" page, most users believe that the content should include “Saved Experts” and “Past Questions.”</li><br>
            <li>Users are confused over the category “Answer” because they do not know if this function is related to receiving an answer or giving an answer. I need to relabel this category into “Give Answer” or “Give Help.”</li>
          </ul><br>

          <h2>SITEMAP
          </h2>
          <p>The Experts' sitemap was built with a co-existing hierarchy structure since there is some overlapping information on the app. For example, if a user were browsing for an expert on the Experts page, the user can easily access the "Ask" page to ask a question. By maintaining this structure, experts can be easily accessible to users through the search bar, "Dashboard" page, and "Experts" page. 
          </p>
          <div><img src="img/experts_sitemap.png" alt="sitemap" class="sitemap"></div>

          <h3 class="blue">Easy Access to Experts
          </h3>
          <p>Because it is important for experts to be easily accessible, I included different approaches that users could take to find the expert they need, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Typing the expert's name into the search bar.</li>
            <li>Finding experts through the various categories on the "Experts" page.</li>
            <li>Looking through "Top Rated Experts" on the "Experts" page.</li>
            <li>Viewing the tab "Recently Used Experts" on the "Dashboard" page.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 class="blue">Various Methods of Communication
          </h3>
          <p>Users will be able to choose their preferred method of communication as this provides them flexibility and comfort. It doesn't matter if their starting point is the "Experts" page or the "Ask" page, because both pathways will lead to the page where they can select their preferred method of communication. 
          </p>

          <h3 class="blue">Have Everything-You-Need on the "Dashboard" Page
          </h3>
          <p>Through card sorting, most users suggested that the "Dashboard" page should include a place where previous experts and questions could be accessed. This would save time for users as it allows them to keep track of their questions and experts.
          </p><br>
          <hr>

          <h1 class="center">PROTOTYPING</h1>

          <h2>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES
          </h2>
          <p>I sketched each user task using pencil and paper. The yellow highlighted area shows the interaction between the user and the app.</p>
          <h3>Feature: Making a Video Call & Payment
          </h3>
          <div><img src="img/lowfid.png" alt="lowfid" class="lowfid"></div>
          <h3 class="blue">Explaining the Process:
          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>User is notified that there is a scheduled video call.
            </li>
            <li>User has the option to accept or reject the video call. 
            </li>
            <li>User will wait to be connected to Francis after tapping the video call icon. 
            </li>
            <li>User can end the session by tapping the bottom video call icon.
            </li>
            <li>User can make a payment by choosing the preferred method of payment.
            </li>
            <li>User will input billing and credit card information.
            </li>
            <li>User is assured that $20 is being transferred to Expert Francis.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>

          <h2>MID-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES
          </h2>

          <p>Using Basalmiq, I turned my paper sketches into a more elaborate prototype, uploaded the wireframes onto Invision, and completed a round of usability testing in-person.</p>
          <h3 class="blue">Findings:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Users need a smooth transition from creating an account to knowing how to use the app.
            </li>
            <li>Users need a way to keep track of their upcoming appointments other than through the notification bell.
            </li>
            <li>Users often found their answers by using the search engine or by searching experts according to categories.
            </li>
            <li>When users are in the process of asking a question, the multiple options that are being presented to choose an expert can be reduced and summarized.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="blue">Design Solutions:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A set of coachmarks was added to the onboarding process to help the users quickly adjust and familiarize themselves on how to use the app's main functions.
            </li>
            <li>A tab called "My Appointments" has been added onto the "Dashboard" for users to view and keep track of their upcoming appointments.
            </li>
            <li>The alphabetized list of categories in the "Ask" page was removed since users often asked questions by accessing the "Experts" page. Plus, it wasn't efficient to scroll through the alphabetized list of categories to locate the category the question fell under. 
            </li>
            <li>A tab called "My Experts" has been added onto the "Dashboard" for users to be able to immediately access their previous experts. 
            </li>
          </ul><br>

          <h2>HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES
          </h2>
          <p>Afterwards, I incorporated the design solutions from the usability testing to create a high-fidelity prototype. Here are some main features of using the Experts app:</p>
          <h3>Feature: Create an Account
          </h3>
          <div><img src="img/highfid-3.png" alt="highfid" class="highfid"></div>

          <h1>REFINING THE DESIGN</h1>

          <h2>PEER FEEDBACK</h2>
          <p>Towards the end of the design process, I received peer feedback and made minor modifications to my final prototype using Sketch.</p><br>

          <br><hr>
          <h1>WHAT I'VE LEARNED</h1>
          <h3>People love Google.
          </h3>
          <p>Google is the best because it gives people autonomy, comfort, and convenience. People like to find answers on their own initiative and timing. Questions don't need to be fully thought out before completing a search. The search can be quick or more extensive, depending on the complexity of the question and what they are looking for.
          </p>
          <h3>A free drink is not a strong incentive to complete a survey.
          </h3>
          <p>Providing an incentive of purchasing a drink for the participant after completion of the tasks isn't necessary since most of my participants did not mind completing the tasks. 
          </p>
          <h3>Emphasis on building community can remove a professional feel. 
          </h3>
          <p>A social platform is created when everyone pitches in their opinion using casual and unfiltered language. Providing various perspectives can come in forms of bias or facts, and it's the facts that create professionalism while biased thoughts can create a social platform.
          </p>
          <h3>The words "sign-in" and "sign-up" are too similar. 
          </h3>
          <p>I learned that most participants do not read carefully because the "sign-in" box was frequently clicked when creating an account instead of the "sign-up" box. 
          </p>
          <h3>A search icon on every screen is unnecessary and takes up space. 
          </h3>
          <p>I cannot understate the importance of having a search bar as participants naturally gravitate towards it to look up experts or questions. However, the search bar does not need to be on every screen as it may remove the focus off what is currently being displayed.
