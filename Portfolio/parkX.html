      <h1>Purpose</h1>
      <p>Early in the CareerFoundry's Immersion Course, I completed a challenge of identifying human needs, motivation, and friction in a product. I chose ParkX to analyze since I was familiar with using the app.</p>
    </div>

          <h1>The Value of ParkX</h1>
          <p>ParkX is an existing parking app that allows you to easily pay for parking from your smartphone. To give a backdrop of how ParkX has changed my life, I have created a step-by-step process of what my life looked like before ParkX existed.</p>

          <h3 class="blue">Life Before ParkX</h3>
          <div><img src="img/beforeparkX.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div>

          <p>Then, see how my life has changed after reaping the benefits of using ParkX. It has allowed me to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gain more time.
            </li>
            <li>Spend less energy.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce frustration & anxiety.
            </li>
            <li>Use less mental bandwidth.
            </li>
          </ul><br>

          <h3>Life After ParkX</h3>
          <div><img src="img/afterparkX.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div>

          <p>Based off my personal experience, I created a user story to identify what the main function should be.</p>

          <h3>User Story</h3>
          <p>"As a busy person, I would like to prevent trips to the parking station to refill my parking time, so I can maximize my time to do other things."</p>
          <p>After creating a user story, I began to identify external triggers using the Fogg Behavior Model and the points of friction to see where improvements could be made. 
          </p><br>

          <h1>Fogg Behavior Model</h1>
          <p>The Fogg Behavior Model has three components that must occur simultaneously to produce a behavior, which are: motivation, ability, and trigger. If the outcome is not a desired behavior, then either the motivation, ability, or trigger is missing. </p>
          <p class="center">Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Trigger</p>
          <p>According to the Fogg Behavior Model, it is difficult to manipulate a person's motivation or ability to complete an action; therefore, the focus is shifted to creating effective triggers to produce a desired behavior.</p><br>

          <h1>Identifying Triggers</h1>
          <p>The purpose of triggers is for users to complete an action. Effective triggers can be things like simplifying a task, giving suggestions to the user, or providing reinforcement.</p>
          <p>I keep using ParkX because of these triggers:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Time-saving
            </li>
            <li>Alert
            </li>
            <li>Sync
            </li>
          </ol><br>

          <h3>Time-saving (Reduction Trigger)</h3>
          <p>Basic functionality is met as the reduction trigger reduces the number of steps by addressing an alternate and convenient way to pay for parking that saves time. After users find parking, they can open up ParkX and walk through four easy steps.</p> 
          <ol>
            <li>Enter the parking zone.</li>
            <li>Select which vehicle to park.</li>
            <li>Input the duration of parking.</li>
            <li>Pay the amount.</li>
          </ol>
          <div><img src="img/parkX_R1.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div>
          <p>The convenience of tapping on a screen beats the inconvenient process of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Finding the nearest parking station.</li>
            <li>Fishing for coins or getting out a debit card.</li>
            <li>Deciding on how much to pay.</li>
            <li>Waiting for a parking sticker to print.</li> 
            <li>Walking back to the car to place the sticker.</li> 
          </ul><br>

          <h3>Alert (Suggestion Trigger)</h3>
          <p>When the session is about to expire, a reminder appears in the form of a pop-up or sound. This suggestion trigger reminds the users to determine their next step of action. They can choose to ignore that their parking session is expiring soon, view how much time is remaining, or extend their parking session. Having this alert feature is handy as it prevents users from getting a parking fine.</p> 
          <div><img src="img/parkX_R2.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div><br>

          <h3>Sync (Reduction Trigger)</h3>
          <p>When purchases are made for parking sessions, there is no need to repeatedly enter in the debit/credit card information because ParkX automatically syncs to the users’ card information. Also, users can set an amount to add whenever their balance drops below $0.00, so they don’t need to constantly track and refill their balance. These reduction triggers result in a smooth transaction experience.</p> 
          <div><img src="img/parkX_R3.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div><br><br>

          <h1>Identifying Friction</h1>

            <p>After identifying triggers, I identified three points of friction:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Unreliable "Finding Parking" feature
              </li>
              <li>Cannot customize reminder
              </li>
              <li>Poorly Organized "Parker History"
              </li>
            </ol><br>

          <h3 class="blue">Unreliable "Finding Parking" Feature</h3>
          <p>ParkX has an option to find parking. However, after users enter the location of area they'd like to find parking or after entering in the parking zone #, often times, a pop-up displays, "Zone Not Found." This friction point occurs in the level of reliability in the Design Hierachy of Needs because the feature does not work consistently.</p> 
          <div><img src="img/parkX_F1.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div><br>

          <h3 class="blue">Cannot Customize Reminder</h3>
          <p>There is a pop-up reminder that tells the users that their session is almost expiring. However, the users cannot adjust the length of time the pop-up reminder should occur before the session expires. For first time users, they would frequently need to open up the app to see how much time is remaining in their session. It would give more autonomy to the users if there was an option to set or adjust the number of minutes before the alarm goes off.</p> 
          <p>This friction point occurs in the level of proficiency in the Design Hierarchy of Needs. Although the reminder notification fulfills the users’ basic needs, it has not anticipated meeting additional needs, such as being able to customize the reminder time.</p>
          <div><img src="img/parkX_F2.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div><br>

          <h3 class="blue">Poorly Organized "Parker History"</h3>
          <p>The "Parker History" feature is good for displaying and keeping track of data throughout the week. There are three important things to take note of which are:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li>the location of parking,</li>
            <li>the day of the week,</li>
            <li>& the cost of payment.</li>
          </ul>
          <div><img src="img/parkX_F3.png" alt="parkX" class="parkX">
          </div>
          <p>How the information is organized is not easy to read and appears cluttered. If the data could be arranged differently, include more visuals, or even have additional features to add up the payments of each day for a sum total, it would bring more value to the users as they could detect useful patterns of where they frequently find parking or plan how to budget given the amount they spend on a given day for parking.</p> 
          <p>This friction point occurs in the level of usability in the Design Hierarchy of Needs because the information architecture is not intuitive to the users, and therefore, difficult to read and draw out patterns.</p><br>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
